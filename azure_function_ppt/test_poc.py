Simple POC Test for PowerPoint Generation Service

Tests the core functionality: Document input â†’ PowerPoint output

Usage:
  python test_poc.py               # Run all tests
  python test_poc.py --long-only   # Run only the long document test
  python test_poc.py --table-only  # Run only the table functionality test

The long document test uses a comprehensive 8,000-word strategic document
to test content-driven slide optimization and should generate 20-30 slides.

The table test uses structured budget and performance data to test automatic
table creation functionality for better data presentation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Our organization stands at a critical juncture where digital transformation is not merely an option but an imperative for sustained competitive advantage. This comprehensive strategy document outlines a five-year roadmap to fundamentally reshape our operational model, customer engagement paradigm, and technological infrastructure. The transformation encompasses seven core domains: technology modernization, data analytics maturity, customer experience optimization, operational efficiency enhancement, workforce digital enablement, cybersecurity fortification, and innovation culture development.

The strategic initiative requires an investment of $12.5 million over five years, with projected ROI of 340% by 2030. Key performance indicators include 85% process automation, 60% improvement in customer satisfaction scores, 45% reduction in operational costs, and establishment of three new digital revenue streams worth $8.2 million annually.

CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

Technology Infrastructure Assessment
Our existing technology landscape presents significant challenges that impede organizational agility. The current infrastructure consists of 47 legacy systems, 23 of which are over eight years old and lack modern integration capabilities. Database fragmentation across 12 different platforms creates data silos that prevent comprehensive business intelligence. Network infrastructure operates at 67% capacity during peak hours, causing performance bottlenecks that affect 340 daily users.

Customer Experience Audit
Customer journey mapping reveals critical friction points that negatively impact satisfaction and retention. Current Net Promoter Score stands at 32, significantly below industry benchmark of 58. Digital touchpoint analysis shows 43% of customer interactions require manual intervention, leading to average response times of 4.2 hours. Mobile experience optimization lags with only 34% of services accessible via mobile platforms.

Operational Efficiency Review
Process analysis identifies substantial automation opportunities across five business functions. Manual data entry consumes 847 hours weekly across all departments. Invoice processing requires average 7.3 days due to approval workflow inefficiencies. Inventory management operates with 23% excess stock due to inadequate demand forecasting capabilities.
